# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hello! My name is Mitun Adenuga (he/him), and I am currently an accelerated Master of Information Systems student at Carnegie Mellon University. I previously earned my B.S. in Information Systems from the same institution. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for UI/UX design, product management, business strategies, and leveraging coding and technology to solve complex problems.

I reside in Maryland and will be returning there for work after graduating in May. I am excited to join the Deloitte office in Arlington, Virginia, where I will continue my professional journey. My connection with Deloitte is strong, having interned at their Arlington office for two summers within the GPS sector of the Consulting division. During my internships, I collaborated with my team to develop solutions that automated processes and enhanced efficiency for our clients.

In the summer of 2024, I expanded my horizons by interning at Deloitte Nigeria on the Strategy and Development Team. This experience allowed me to contribute to new AI initiatives aimed at fostering innovation within Nigeria and across Africa. These diverse experiences have equipped me with a unique perspective and a robust skill set that I am eager to apply in my future endeavors.

I am currently enrolled in the "Telling Stories with Data" class to further enhance my ability to create compelling data visualizations. This course is crucial for me as it focuses on modernizing charts and graphs to effectively communicate data-driven stories. By mastering these skills, I aim to present data in a way that is not only visually appealing but also meaningful and impactful. Understanding how to convey complex information clearly and engagingly is essential in today's data-driven world, and I am excited to apply these techniques in my future projects and professional roles.

# What I hope to learn
In the "Telling Stories with Data" course, I am eager to deepen my understanding of data visualization techniques and tools. My goal is to learn how to create visually compelling and meaningful charts that effectively communicate data-driven stories. This skill is essential for my future career, as it will enable me to present complex information clearly and engagingly.

Specifically, I hope to learn:

- Advanced data visualization techniques
- Best practices for designing interactive and user-friendly charts
- How to use various data visualization tools and software
- Strategies for effectively communicating data insights to diverse audiences
- The principles of storytelling with data to make impactful presentations

Upon graduating, I plan to apply these skills in my role at Deloitte, where I will be working in the Arlington, Virginia office. I aim to leverage data visualization to enhance the solutions we provide to our clients, making data more accessible and actionable. Additionally, I am excited to continue exploring new AI initiatives and contribute to innovative projects that drive efficiency and growth.



# Portfolio
Crafting for Clarity - Week Two (Discussion/Workbook)
Working with Tableau: Visualizing Government Debt
Part I: Final project


# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it. 

## Assignment: [Visualizing overnment Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `visualizing-government-debt.md`.  For links to Markdown files in your repository, you can just include the name of the page without the `.md` extension. 

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this assignment, make sure you set up and link to a new page.  This page is linking to a new Markdown document called `critique-by-design.md`.  

## Final project
Here it might be helpful to include a high-level description of your final project. 
[Part I](final-project-part-one)
[Part II](final-project-part-two)
Part III(final-project-part-three)

## Other stuff you can do (you can remove this section - it's just for your reference.)

### Changing text

You can change text, like this: 

**Here's some bold** text.  Here's some *italic* text. Here's some ~~strikethrough~~ text. 

### Creating tables

You can build tables like this: 

| Name         | Type of pet | Favority activity 1 | FA 2   | FA 3            | FA 4                                |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| Eli          | cat         | Sleeping            | Eating | Being pet       | Plotting to overthow dog empire     |
| Howard       | dog         | You                 | You    | You             | Eating                              |
| Frankenstein | fish        | Swimming            | Eating | Blowing bubbles | Forgetting                          |

An easy-to-use template generator tool [can be found here](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)

You can use different headings, like this: 

# Here's a large title (H1)
## Here's a subtitle (H2)
### ...and so on (H3)
You get the idea - just don't forget the space between the # and your title.  `#Title` won't work, but `# Title` will. 

### Adding images

Here's an example of how to add an image to my portfolio.  

![funny dog picture](funny-dog-unsplash.jpg)
> Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/pt-br/@charlesdeluvio?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">charlesdeluvio</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/K4mSJ7kc0As?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a>
  

Alternately, you can set the size of the image using just a bit of HTML: 

<img src="funny-dog-unsplash.jpg" width="200"/>

Remember that you'll need to upload the image into your repository, or include a link to the image somewhere else.  

### Setting up a separate page

So here's the code you'll need to add to your own site to create a second page. 

1. First, create a new page in your repository (for example, dataviz1.md)
2. Next, add a link to that page by inserting the following into your readme.md page:

`[title](dataviz)` or `[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` or `[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)`

Any of those formats will work. Here's some examples of working links: 

`[title](dataviz)` = [title](dataviz)  
`[dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)` = [dataviz](https://cmustudent.github.io/portfolio/dataviz.html)  
`[CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)` = [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu)   

Make sure to check these from your publicly accessible URL to make sure they're working correctly (not from the preview tab).
