# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 
 
Climate change is reshaping our world, with one of its most visible and devastating effects being the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters. This project aims to visualize and analyze the relationship between climate change and the occurrence of natural disasters, specifically focusing on hurricanes, wildfires, and floods over the past few decades.

Project Structure

Exposition (Setting the Stage)
Our story begins with a look at the Earth's climate over the past century. We introduce the audience to the concept of global temperature anomalies, showing how the planet has been warming, especially since the 1970s.

 - Visualization: A line graph showing global temperature anomalies from 1920 to 2023, with a clear upward trend accelerating in recent decades.

Rising Action (The Growing Threat)
As temperatures rise, we start to see changes in natural disaster patterns. This section builds tension by revealing the increasing frequency and intensity of hurricanes, wildfires, and floods.
- Visualizations:
  A stacked area chart showing the annual occurrence of hurricanes, major wildfires, and significant floods over the past 50 years.
  Maps show the expansion of areas affected by these disasters over time.

Climax (The Climate Connection)
The story reaches its peak as we reveal the stark correlation between climate change indicators and disaster patterns. This is the "aha" moment where the audience clearly sees the link between rising temperatures and intensifying natural disasters.
- Visualization: A scatter plot or heat map showing the relationship between global temperature anomalies and disaster frequency/intensity.

Falling Action (The Human and Economic Toll)
With the climate-disaster connection established, we explore the consequences. This section humanizes the data by showing the impact on lives and livelihoods.
- Visualizations:
  A bar chart comparing lives lost and economic damages from disasters in different decades.
  An infographic showing the disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities.

Resolution (Looking Ahead and Call to Action)
The story concludes by looking to the future, presenting potential scenarios based on current climate models. We end with a call to action, emphasizing the importance of climate 
mitigation and adaptation strategies.
- Visualizations:
 Projections of disaster frequency and intensity under different climate scenarios.
 An interactive element allowing users to explore potential impacts of climate action (or inaction) on future disaster trends.
 This arc takes the audience on a journey from understanding the problem to recognizing its severity and, finally, to considering solutions. It's designed to be both informative and     
 emotionally engaging, using data to tell a compelling story about one of the most pressing issues of our time.

This data-driven story reveals the alarming increase in frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, demonstrating the urgent need for action to mitigate future catastrophes and protect vulnerable communities.

User Stories
As a policymaker, I want to understand the relationship between climate change and natural disasters so that I can advocate for effective climate policies.

As a concerned citizen, I want to see clear evidence of how climate change is affecting natural disasters so that I can make informed decisions about supporting climate action.

As a student, I want to learn about the trends in different types of natural disasters so that I can better understand the complex impacts of climate change.

As a community leader, I want to grasp the potential future scenarios of climate-related disasters so that I can help my community prepare and adapt.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
